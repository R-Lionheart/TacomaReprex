This repository is a mini version of the full Thea Foss Tacoma repository. It has been edited for length and isolation of a particular error. 

Comments have been marked with a TODO: tag for easy identification. 

The scripts that have been tagged with a "kirkedit" suffix indicate the revised scripts that have already been sent over, with the <ys> error replaced with <y>. 

In order to produce the error for troubleshooting, open and run the Y_error_reprex.R script. The error should be the following:

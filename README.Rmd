This repository is a mini version of the full Thea Foss Tacoma repository. It has been edited for length and isolation of a particular error. 

Comments have been marked with a TODO: tag for easy identification. 

Scripts that have the kirkedit3 tag indicate the latest versions from email communications, in order to differentiate them from previous versions.

This repository is a mini version of the full Thea Foss Tacoma repository. It has been edited for length and isolation of a particular error. 

Comments have been marked with a TODO: tag for easy identification. 

The scripts that have been tagged with a "kirkedit2" suffix indicate the revised scripts that have already been sent over, with the <ys> error replaced with <y>, and the deparsing errors solved.  

In order to produce the error for troubleshooting, open and run the error.R script. The error should be the following: 

Error in `map()` at scripts_original/ci_band_lm_kirkedit2.R:159:4:
â„¹ In index: 5.
Caused by error in `X.piv %*% object$cov`:
